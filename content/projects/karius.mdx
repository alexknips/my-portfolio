The Karius Test is a liquid biopsy that can non-invasively and rapidly detect over 1000 pathogens causing both deep-seated and bloodstream infections from a single blood sample. The Karius Test may help clinicians avoid invasive, low-yield, and sequential diagnostic tests that can delay treatment for vulnerable hospitalized patients.
